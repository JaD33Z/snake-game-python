# snake-game-python
  Snake game build using python and "turtle" library(for the graphic user interface.)
  Project is from Angela Yu's course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro BootCamp for 2021".
  Files, variables, and classes are named accordingly to the elements of the game to keep code reading
  straight forward. Fun beginner/intermediate project.
# data.txt file is only for score keeping purposes in the game.
